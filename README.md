# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning
Deep Reinforcement Learning Project Code
Tasks 1-8 were run in a jupyter notebook environment, while due to issues with the latter tasks 9 and 10 were decided to be run in google colab because there it could be implemented a T4-GPU, which made things easier in terms of runnning time. Additionally the implementation of the rllib algorithm in the Atari environment was smooth and without hiccups, contrary to when it was tried in the jupyter notebook.
