# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning

Task 1: Construct transition and reward functions to represent a maze-like reinforcement learning problem, and solve it using the Q-Learning algorithm.

Task 2: Implement a DQN in the ‘CartPole-v1’ environment with two improvements: Double DQN and Multi-Step Double DQN.

Task 3: Apply a Dueling DQN to the Atari Learning Environment, Pong.

The code for tasks 1 and 2 was run in a Jupyter notebook environment, while, due to issues with the latter environment the code for task 3 was decided to be run in Google Colab because a T4-GPU could be implemented there.
